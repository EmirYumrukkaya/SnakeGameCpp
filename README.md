🐍➕➕ Snake Game in C++ – Console Edition 🐍➕➕

A lightweight, retro-style Snake game built entirely using C++. It runs in the terminal and offers a classic experience : your score gets saved to a file after every game — so you can chase your high scores.

🕹️ About the Game

Move the snake, eat the food, and try not to crash into the walls or yourself. The more you eat, harder it becomes to stay alive.

This version doesn't rely on graphics or libraries — just plain C++ and raw logic, making it simple .

💾 Score Tracking

Each time you finish a game, your score is written to a file called Score.txt. This allows you to keep a log of previous runs.
